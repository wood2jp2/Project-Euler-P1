Project Euler - Problem #1.3

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

PERSONAL NOTES:

Not too too difficult. I wanted to solve this quickly using two variables, one tracking sum (total) and the other being the counter (i). I used a simple 'for' statement to initiate the counter, as we know the approximate end (1,000). Using an if statement to describe the two cases (if i was a multiple of 3 or 5) I was able to grab those sums and continuously add them to the total, and print the result.
